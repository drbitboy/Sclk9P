Directory and documents from Planetary Data System (PDS) archive data set

http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/di-c-hrii_hriv_mri_its-6-doc-set-v4.0/

in relative directory

  document/flight_data/di/spacecraft_clock_correlation/

describing initial work on Deep Impact Spacecraft Clock correlation ca.
2006, leading to this project.


================
SCU_BP_Temps.xls
================

Tables of DI Flyby and Impactor SCU baseplate temperatures, as a function
of time, leading up to the impact with Comet 9P/Tempel 1.  These tables
are the basis for files *_scutemp.txt in the top directory for this
project.


===============================================
ImpTimeCorr_doy170_181_with_Plot_wo_Hex2Dec.ods
ImpTimeCorr_doy170_181_with_Plot_wo_Hex2Dec.xls
===============================================

Workbook, in OpenOffice and Microsoft eXcel formats, of correlation
data between Impactor and Flyby clocks over the last fortnight before the
impact with Comet 9P/Tempel 1 impact.  Original eXcel version from Amy
Walsh is in zzOriginals.  These tables are the basis for file
dii_dif_diffs.txt in the top directory for this project.

SER_DI-SC-CDH-053_Oscillator_-_Vendor_Data_and_Analysis.doc
===========================================================

Vendor-supplied data about oscillators supplied to DI project


============
sclk_fix.asc
============

SCLK Data Processing Anomalies, from Deep Impact documentation data set
in the Planetary Data System (PDS).  This ASCII document contains
background information about the DI spacecraft clocks and the
representation of spacecraft time on the DI spacecraft.  The original
source data set URL is

http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/di-c-hrii_hriv_mri_its-6-doc-set-v4.0/

and the relative path from there to that file is
