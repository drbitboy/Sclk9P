That directory and documents came from the Planetary Data System (PDS)
archive data set:

  - http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/di-c-hrii_hriv_mri_its-6-doc-set-v4.0/

in relative directory

  - document/flight_data/di/spacecraft_clock_correlation/

and describe the initial work on Deep Impact Spacecraft Clock
correlation ca.  2006, leading to this project.


Tables of DI Flyby and Impactor SCU baseplate temperatures
==========================================================

SCU_BP_Temps.xls

- Tables of DI Flyby and Impactor SCU baseplate temperatures, as a function
  of time, leading up to the impact with Comet 9P/Tempel 1.  These tables
  are the basis for files *_scutemp.txt in the top directory for this
  project.


Workbook of SCLK correlation data between DIF and DII
=====================================================

ImpTimeCorr_doy170_181_with_Plot_wo_Hex2Dec.ods

ImpTimeCorr_doy170_181_with_Plot_wo_Hex2Dec.xls

- Workbook, in OpenOffice and Microsoft eXcel formats, of correlation data
  between Impactor and Flyby clocks over the last fortnight before the
  impact with Comet 9P/Tempel 1 impact.  Original eXcel version from Amy
  Walsh is in zzOriginals.  These tables are the basis for file
  dii_dif_diffs.txt in the top directory of this project.


Vendor-supplied data about oscillators supplied to DI project
===========================================================

SER_DI-SC-CDH-053_Oscillator_-_Vendor_Data_and_Analysis.doc



SCLK Data Processing Anomalies
==============================

sclk_fix.asc

- SCLK Data Processing Anomalies, from Deep Impact documentation data set
  in the Planetary Data System (PDS).  This ASCII document contains
  background information about the DI spacecraft clocks and the
  representation of spacecraft time on the DI spacecraft.  The original
  source data set URL is

http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/di-c-hrii_hriv_mri_its-6-doc-set-v4.0/

  and the relative path from there to that file is

    document/flight_data/sclk_fix/sclk_fix.asc

VTC correlation corrections
===========================

zzOriginals/TimeCorrelationCorrections.xls

- Email and attachment from Amy Walsh with VTC correlation corrections,
  these are the basis for other ImpTimeCorr_doy170_181_...* files
