Abstract                                                                      
                                                                              
Based on the available spacecraft data and advice from spacecraft             
engineering personnel, the earth/flyby clock correlation is good to one or    
two seconds, and the inter-spacecraft clock correlation is good to half a     
second.                                                                       
                                                                              
For the purposes of this archive, we have adjusted the earth/flyby            
spacecraft clock correlation to agree with an interpolation, over the         
encounter period, of available earth/flyby timing correlation data, and we    
have adjusted the earth/impactor spacecraft clock correlation to agree        
with the flyby correlation on the Time Of Impact to within 60ms. The          
spacecraft-to-comet trajectory kernels have been adjusted to agree with       
these timing correlations.                                                    
                                                                              
It may be possible in the future to adjust the spacecraft clocks'             
correlations up to perhaps two seconds using the available temperature        
history of the spacecraft control unit baseplate as an analog for the         
spacecraft clocks' oscillators.                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
Introduction                                                                  
                                                                              
This document summarizes the rationale for the archived correlations          
between the Deep Impact (DI) Flyby and Impactor Spacecraft Clocks (SCLKs)     
and Dynamical Barycentric Time (TDB) that are encapsulated in the SPICE       
SCLK-Kernel files in the PDS archive of DI data. This document also           
explains why the clock correlation was changed about 2 seconds,               
retroactively, shortly after impact with comet 9P/Tempel 1.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
Background                                                                    
                                                                              
The correlation between real time TDB and spacecraft clock time is            
essential to mission data analysis. The correlation, expressed as rates       
between known points in both time systems (SCLK & TDB), is determined from    
analysis of spacecraft clock correlation packet data, and made accessible     
via a standard SCLK versus SpaceCraft Event Time (SCLKvSCET) file in the      
format of a SPICE SCLK-Kernel. A complete explanation of the SPICE SCLK       
system is beyond the scope of this document, but is available at the NAIF     
web site, http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/doc_C.html as the Spacecraft Clock    
Required Reading document (sclk.req).                                         
                                                                              
For the purposes of this document, the clock on either DI spacecraft is       
adequately described as two cascading counters. The "subtick" counter runs    
from 0 to 255 at about 256Hz and therefore overflows about once every         
second. The "tick" counter runs from 0 to [2^32 - 1] and increments every     
time the "subtick" counter overflows. This discussion will mostly focus on    
the "tick" count. However, it should be noted that the SCLK time is           
represented as strings of digits representing the two counters, separated     
by a period (e.g. "173727702.100"). It should also be noted that the          
separator is not a decimal point, and that the SCLK string 173727702.1        
represents the same time as 1773727702.001, but a different time than         
17727702.100.                                                                 
                                                                              
In the formal SPICE system, there is also a partition prefix in the SCLK      
time (e.g. "1/0173727702.100"), but the partition may be ignored for the      
purposes of this document. As noted above, more information is available in   
the NAIF/SPICE Spacecraft Clock Required Reading document.                    
                                                                              
Shortly before launch in mid-January, 2006, the mission clocks' tick counts   
were set to be the number of seconds since the J2000 epoch (01-Jan-2000       
12:00:00 UTC or +64.184s TDB). The Flyby clock's drift, i.e. the difference   
between SCLK tick and TDB rates, was about one second per day, and the        
Flyby clock ran slower than TDB. That is, the difference [TDB - SCLK ticks]   
increased about one second per day.                                           
                                                                              
Based on the appearance of the impact flash in flyby images at encounter,     
the Time Of Impact (TOI) was 173727702.218 on the Flyby clock. Based on       
geometric analysis by Dennis Wellnitz of the Impactor's final encounter       
images TOI was 173727875.105 on the Impactor clock.                           
                                                                              
It should also be noted that there might be a delay between the actual        
impact and the appearance of the impact flash; co-investigators on the        
project have estimated this delay could be as large as 200ms.                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
Discussion                                                                    
                                                                              
During DI operations, the spacecraft was commanded to generate clock          
correlation data from time to time. The periods between successive            
correlations ranged from a few days to five weeks.                            
                                                                              
The Flyby SCLK correlation points closest to TOI are on DOYs 164 and          
187, over twenty days before and two days after TOI. The Impactor SCLK        
correlation point closest to TOI is on DOY 164, over twenty days before       
TOI.                                                                          
                                                                              
Based on interpolation between the Flyby SCLK correlation points, one of      
which is within two days of TOI, the Flyby-determined TOI of                  
                                                                              
    173727702.218 +/- approximately 6 subticks                                
                                                                              
corresponds to                                                                
                                                                              
    2005-185 05:44:34.265 UTC +/- 25ms                                        
                                                                              
at the Flyby spacecraft. Light travel time means the impact actually took     
place 2ms earlier.                                                            
                                                                              
Based on that work, the NAV team adjusted the Impactor ephemeris so that      
TOI occurs at 05:44:34.200, and the clock rate of the Impactor SCLK-          
Kernel was adjusted so that the Impactor-determined TOI of                    
                                                                              
   173727875.105 +/- approximately 77 subticks                                
                                                                              
 corresponds to                                                               
                                                                              
   2005-185 05:44:34.200  +/- 300ms                                           
                                                                              
The 63ms of difference between the final correlations was due to a slight     
mis-communication, and it was declared by the Principal Investigator that     
this was close enough.                                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
The Two-Second Shift                                                          
                                                                              
During mission operations, the project generated updated versions of the      
SCLK-Kernel files as clock correlation data became available. Due to          
operational restrictions, interpolation could not be used in these project    
kernels between the most recent correlation point and the previous point.     
Instead, the project used extrapolation, which process, when coupled with     
other restriction, caused artifacts in the correlation. Here is a brief       
summary of the origin of the artifacts from the DI Flyby SCLK-Kernel file     
by Boris Semenov of JPL:                                                      
                                                                              
    Traditionally the SCLK correlation function provided in the               
    SCLKvSCET file had to comply with two requirements (in order to           
    maintain correct tagging/sorting by UTC in the ground system):            
                                                                              
      1)  The correlation must be continuous, and                             
      2)  The must be backward compatible (meaning that drift rates           
          for the past epochs must not change).                               
                                                                              
    To achieve that every update of SCLKvSCET introduced two points:          
    one "real" data point with actual estimated drift and one                 
    "artificial" data point about 5000 seconds before the actual point        
    with a bogus drift rate, just to connect the previous trend with          
    the new one in a continuous fashion.                                      
                                                                              
    Arguably, the right thing to do to make the SCLK kernel better            
    reflect real clock trend was to have the ``artificial'' points            
    dropped and change coefficients of the ``real'' points to                 
    ``connect'' the real points into a continuous piece-wise line             
    function. This way the drift rates that were initially estimated          
    slightly incorrectly would be changed to make the correlation             
    match the reality better.                                                 
                                                                              
    Exactly this was done to the final official SCLKvSCET to get the          
    modified version that used to produce this SCLK kernel.                   
                                                                              
Figure 1 presents a plot of (TDB - SCLK ticks) illustrates these processes    
graphically; it shows TDB advancing about one second per day relative to      
the flyby SCLK, as noted above.                                               
                                                                              
<fig1_flyby_sclk_offset.png>

about one second per day relative to the flyby SCLK.                          
                                                                              
The white curves and points show what Boris Semenov calls the "right          
thing to do" i.e. a piecewise linear interpolation between known points.      
                                                                              
The cyan plots represent the project's synthetic approach to the data points.

SCLKvSCET File Creation" below.                                               
                                                                              
During encounter, the white segment "ef" represents the interpolated          
science correlation, and the cyan segment "eg" represents the extrapolated    
project correlation. At the Time Of Impact (TOI), the difference is about     
two seconds between the extrapolated and interpolated correlations.           
                                                                              
                                                                              
Operational Approach to SCLKvSCET File Creation                               
                                                                              
Focusing on the interval from DOY 095 through 129, the actual correlation     
points available to the project during that interval were "a" on DOY 083      
and "b" on DOY 095. Using those two points, the project calculated the        
segment "ab" by interpolation, and extrapolated that line forward in time     
past DOY 095 (cyan segment "bd" and beyond) for operational use. When the     
correlation point "c" became available on DOY 129, they created the           
correlation point "d" about 5000 seconds before "c" as an artifice to (1)     
maintain backward compatibility as noted above (i.e. to not change any        
SCLK to SCET conversions performed using segment "bd"), and (2) terminate     
the previous extrapolation from "b". They also created the segment "cd" to    
(1) bring the operational correlation back to a real datum, and (2)           
maintain a continuous correlation.                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
The Temperature Monkey Wrench                                                 
                                                                              
The SCLK oscillator rates are dependent on temperature, and Figure 2          
presents two plots that indicate the approach and encounter temperature       
history of the SCUs.  The time coverage is from about DOYs 170 through        
187.

Figure 2.  Two plots illustrating the temperature history of the SCUs for     
the approach and encounter phases of the mission.                             
                                                                              
There are also ground-based data that show the effect of temperature on       
the oscillator frequencies. The Figure 3 presents a plot that show the        
relative offset between the two spacecraft clocks during approach and         
encounter. Note that this plot is the offset of one spacecraft's SCLK         
relative to the other, and does not involve TDB or UTC. The point to be       
made here, however, is that both Amy Walsh and Brian Carcich have verified    
that the temperature variations around encounter, coupled with the effect     
of temperature on oscillator frequency, may account for the single blue       
point labeled "Possible bad point ..." and one second or more of              
uncertainty with respect to TDB and UTC.
