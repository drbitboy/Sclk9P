Subject: RE: SUMMARY:  16 Dec Telecon, 8 am PST:  TOI & Clock Correlations

Attached is an Excel file that contains all of my working data and
summaries of the reconstructed time correlation (TC) and external VTC latch
packet data. Since we spoke on Friday, I discovered that much of the data I
thought I had left to process for the Flyby did not have enough supporting
information to allow me to reconstruct the missing nibble with certainty.
The surrounding packets and command log info for DOY 178 only narrowed the
missing nibble down to two possible values. The command log information was
not available for the DOY 187 sessions and the I therefore left this data
out of my summary data if the surrounding packets did not adequately bound
the TC packet timestamps.
 
John Swift: the data for Flyby SCU-A is on the worksheet:
"FBTimeCorrFinal." This data is referenced from my working spreadsheet, so
you will probably want to save that sheet as a text file before working
with it. The data for Impactor is on "ImpTimeCorrFinal." The same goes for
this spreadsheet.
 
I'd appreciate a second set of eyes on my working spreadsheets, so if
anyone has questions on this stuff, please let me know.
 
Thanks,
Amy
