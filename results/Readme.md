Understanding what the DI SpaceCraft cLocKs (SCLKs) were doing
around encounter.

Background
==========

The two Deep Impact (DI) spacecraft, the DI Flyby (DIF) and DI Impactor (DII), have independent SpaceCraft cLocKs (SCLKs).  The correlations of those SCLKs with each other, and with TDB, have been adjusted to fix the time of the DII Time Of Impact (TOI), with comet 9P/Tempel 1, at UTC 2005-07-04T05:44:34.2; that time matches the ephemeris in the final ephemeris solution provided by Dan Kubitschek (JPL Optical Navigation Group).  Based on the appearance of the impact flash in DIF images at encounter, the TOI was 173727702.218 on the DIF clock.  Based on geometric analysis by Dennis Wellnitz(University of Maryland) of the DII final encounter images, TOI was 173727875.105 on the DII clock.  More background on these issues is available in the [accompanying documentation](../doc/spacecraft_clock_correlation/), extracted from the [DI mission documentation data set](http://pdssbn.astro.umd.edu/holdings/di-c-hrii_hriv_mri_its-6-doc-set-v4.0/document/flight_data/di/spacecraft_clock_correlation/).
